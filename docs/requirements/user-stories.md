- _`US-CU-03` — Customer story #3_
- _`US-AD-02` — Admin story #2_

### Priority Guide

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Critical** | System cannot function without this |
| **High** | Core value — needed for launch |
| **Medium** | Important but can ship without |
| **Low** | Nice to have — future enhancement |
