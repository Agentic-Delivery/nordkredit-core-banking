# Data Structures

COBOL copybook definitions and their mapped .NET equivalents.

## Status

No data structures have been documented yet. Copybook mappings will be added as each domain is analyzed.

## Expected Coverage

- COBOL copybook field definitions
- .NET class/record mappings
- EBCDIC-to-Unicode conversion rules
- Field-level validation constraints
- Db2-to-Azure SQL schema mappings
