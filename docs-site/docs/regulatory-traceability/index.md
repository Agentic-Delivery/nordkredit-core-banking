## Status

All 54 extracted business rules have been mapped to their applicable regulations in the [consolidated traceability matrix](./traceability-matrix.md). Each business rule document also includes an inline regulatory mapping section linking the rule to specific regulation articles.

Coverage gaps have been identified for each regulation and are documented in the matrix to guide future extraction work.
